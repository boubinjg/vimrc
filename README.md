# vimrc
This is my vimrc. Students have asked for it in the past, so I figured I would post an updated version here.

This rc includes a few plugins that should be installed with Plug

Note that the included install script (which is very very simple) does not install the plugins. You have to do that using :PlugInstall in vim.
